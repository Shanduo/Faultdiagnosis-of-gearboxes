# Two gearbox dataset
## Exprimental gearbox dataset
 The test rig is composed of a brake, a planetary gearbox, a balancing disc, a torque transducer, and an electric motor. The vibration signals were first collected using the HD-YD-232 piezoelectric accelerometer on the gearbox housing. Then the data acquisition card transformed the collected signals into the computer. The sampling frequency is 10.24 kHz. There are four kinds of gearbox faults: ring gear tooth fracture, planetary gear tooth fracture, sun wheel tooth fracture, and outer race pitting of the rolling bearing. The health conditions include the normal state, single fault, double fault, triple fault, and compound fault of rolling bearing and gear.

## Windturbine gearbox dataset
The vibration signals were measured using the accelerometer on the low-speed shaft during a two-year run-to-failure process. Then the signals were recorded through the condition monitoring system (CMS). The frequency was set to 25.6 kHz. The raw data with 131072 points was recorded once a day. The wind turbine gearbox dataset was collected under five different health conditions. These health conditions include the normal state, wear fault of a bearing, ball drop fault of a bearing, cage crack fault of a bearing, and ball wear fault of a bearing.
